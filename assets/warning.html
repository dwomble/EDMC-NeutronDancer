<h2>Galaxy Plotter</h2>
<p>With the Galaxy Plotter it is possible to get yourself stuck especially if your ship has changed since you plotted the route. <span style="color:#ff0000">You have been warned!</span></p>

<h3>Routing Algorithm</h3>
<p>Which routing algorithm to use, different algorithms may work faster, find better routes or in some cases be unable to find a route.</p>

<p><b>Fuel</b> Prioritises saving fuel, will not scoop fuel or supercharge. Will make the smallest jumps possible in order to preserve fuel as much as possible.</p>

<p><b>Fuel Jumps</b> Prioritises saving fuel, will not scoop fuel or supercharge. Will make the smallest jumps possible in order to preserve fuel as much as possible. Once it has generated a route it will then attempt to minimise the number of jumps to use the entire fuel tank. It will attempt to save only enough fuel to recharge the internal fuel tank once. If you have generated a particularly long route it is likely that you will need to recharge more than once and as such you will most likely run out of fuel.</p>

<p><b>Optimistic</b> Prioritises Neutron jumps. Penalises areas of the galaxy which have large gaps between neutron stars. Typically generates the fastest route with fewest total jumps.</p>

<p><b>Pessimistic</b> Prioritises calculation speed. Overestimates the average star distance to filter out routes. This means it calculates routes faster but the routes are typically less optimal.</p>
